This repository contains tools that use OpenCV library and implement more complex operations and functionality. A short demonstration of it's functionality can be viewed in Jupyter Notebook [Demo](demo.ipynb)

# Preparation.ipynb - OpenCV-Python

## Overview

The `preparation.ipynb` notebook is a comprehensive guide designed to help users set up and utilize OpenCV for various computer vision tasks. This notebook covers the following key areas:

1. **Environment Setup**: Instructions for setting up the necessary Python environment and installing OpenCV.
2. **Loading and Displaying Images**: Techniques for loading images from disk and displaying them using OpenCV and matplotlib.
3. **Basic Image Processing**: Examples of basic image processing tasks such as converting images to grayscale, resizing, and rotating images.
4. **Drawing on Images**: Methods to draw shapes, lines, and text on images.
5. **Image Thresholding**: Demonstrations of different thresholding techniques to segment images.
6. **Smoothing and Blurring**: Applying various blurring techniques to images to reduce noise and detail.
7. **Edge Detection**: Using edge detection algorithms like Canny to identify edges within an image.
8. **Morphological Transformations**: Applying morphological operations such as erosion, dilation, opening, and closing to process images.
9. **Image Gradients**: Calculating image gradients using Sobel and Laplacian operators.
10. **Histograms**: Understanding and plotting image histograms to analyze image intensity distributions.
11. **Image Contours**: Detecting and drawing contours on images.
12. **Object Detection**: Techniques for detecting objects within images using Haar cascades.

## Usage

### Environment Setup

To get started, ensure you have Python and OpenCV installed. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
